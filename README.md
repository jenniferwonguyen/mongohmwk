### Trial and Errors
Through using localhost:3000 (which was changed from various ports due to complications) I was able to scrape and get most functionality of the app, but after deploying on heroku and getting a pool of errors. Tried to get through them all and but one came after another. Let me know what your comments and advice maybe to prevent future errors. I've attached along a image of heroku deployement- deployment, succeeds but gives back --tail error.
